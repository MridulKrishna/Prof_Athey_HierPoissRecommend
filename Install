There is an example makefile to compile the code. It should run by just typing make.

The libraries gsl and gslblas needed. In order to run the makefile, check the paths
to the include and lib directories.

For Windows users: classes Env and Log use the function mkdir(), which only works in
Unix systems. I don't have a PC, so I could not test an alternative code that would
run those lines. In order to run on Windows, find an equivalent function that
creates a folder.
